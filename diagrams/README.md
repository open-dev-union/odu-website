## Diagrams

To provide a clear picture of our Discord bot's structure and operations, we've created a series of diagrams that illustrate key components and interactions. These diagrams were created using [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/), a free, open-source diagramming tool.

### Viewing the Diagrams
There are two ways to view our diagrams:

1. **Exported Images**: For quick and easy viewing, we've exported our diagrams as images under [./static/diagramming-exported](../static/diagramming-exported) folder, so you can view them directly on GitHub without needing any special software!

2. **XML Files**: For interactive experience you can view the diagrams through source files. To view or edit such files, you'll need to open them with diagrams.net platform.

### Contributing to the Diagrams
We welcome contributions! If you have a suggestion for improving a diagram, or if you'd like to create a new diagram that illustrates some aspect of our project, please feel free to do so. Just be sure to save your diagram as a diagrams.net XML file and export it as a PNG image. Then, you can submit a pull request with your changes.

Remember, diagrams are an important part. They help everyone understand the project better and can make it easier to contribute to the project.
