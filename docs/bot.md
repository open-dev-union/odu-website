The bot project is a central part of our community!

In this section,we dive into exploring objectives, design, and functionalities of the Bot project. The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of it, how it serves our community, and how you can contribute to its development.
Whether you're a seasoned developer or a beginner, your unique skills and perspectives can help shape this bot to better serve our community.

## Business Objective(s)
The creation of our own Bot for OpenDevUnion is an initiative aimed at automating various tasks within our Discord server. While we currently utilize several free bot applications provided by Discord, we've found these to be somewhat **limited** in their capabilities. By developing our custom bot, we can fully tailor its functionalities to meet our community's unique needs.

Moreover, this project serves as an excellent opportunity for our community members ðŸ‘¥ to apply their knowledge and skills in a real-world project.

We believe that giving clear documentation of the objectives provides a common understanding for all interested persons. That's why we break it down into 3 pieces: What, Why and How? 

### What Is it ?
Aims to develop a comprehensive platform to foster an engaging, supportive, and collaborative environment for software developers, primarily those new to the field. This platform comprises:

1. **Discord Bot**: Automates community management tasks, facilitates open-source project collaborations, and provides helpful resources.
2. **Web App**: Serves as an extension of the Discord bot's functionalities, offering a more comprehensive and accessible interface for users.
3. **Mobile app** (potential): Ensures accessibility and convenience for community members using mobile devices.
4. **Documentation**: Useful information about the project and bot's usage in one easily navigable location.

### How To Do It ?
A collaborative, open-source process, with community members contributing to different aspects based on their skills and interests:

- **Discord bot**: This is the initial focus, setting the foundation for the other subprojects.
- **Web App**: Designed to complement and extend the functionalities of the bot, with an emphasis on user-friendliness and accessibility.
- **Mobile app** (if developed): Designed with a similar user experience as the web app, ensuring consistency across platforms (Android/iOS).
- **Documentation**: Developed concurrently with the other components to ensure up-to-date and comprehensive information is available to users.

### Why Doing It ?
The project aims to address the observed limitations of existing platforms and the challenges faced by new developers today. By developing these projects/components, we provide an engaging, supportive, and accessible platform for developers to learn, collaborate, and apply their skills. This not only enhances the overall community experience but also empowers developers in their learning journey.

### Small Manageable Parts
